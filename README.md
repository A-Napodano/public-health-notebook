# Learning Biostatistics with Python üêç
Welcome to my repository for learning biostatistics! This project serves as a personal log and toolkit as I work through my biostatistics course, translating concepts and assignments into a working knowledge of Python. The goal is to build a strong, open-source foundation in data analysis that will be useful for future academic and professional work. This repository documents my learning process and contains reusable tools for common statistical tasks.

# Repository Structure
The project is organized to keep learning materials, datasets, and custom tools separate and easy to navigate.

notebooks/: This directory contains the main Jupyter Notebook where I perform analyses, visualize data, and document my work.

datasets/: Any datasets used in the notebooks are stored here.

my_stats_tools.py: A custom Python module containing reusable functions for common statistical tasks, such as creating stem-and-leaf plots or frequency distributions.

# üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up your environment and explore the project.
1. Prerequisites: I started using the Anaconda Distribution, which comes pre-packaged with Python and all the necessary data science libraries (pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter, etc.). While not necessarily a prerequisite, I did find it useful to install almost everything in one go.

2. Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using Git
```
git clone https://github.com/A-Napodano/public-health-notebook.git
cd public-health-notebook
```
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook
```
jupyter notebook
```

# üõ†Ô∏è Using the Custom Tools
The my_stats_tools.py file contains helper functions to simplify common analyses. To use these functions in any notebook, simply place the notebook in the root directory or add the project path, then import the module at the top of your notebook.
```python
import my_stats_tools as mst
```
Feel free to add your own functions to this file as you build out your toolkit!
